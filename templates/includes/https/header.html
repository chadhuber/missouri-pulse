       This data measures whether <a href="{{ site.data.domains_url }}">Missouri government domains</a> support the HTTPS protocol (<code>https://</code>), and the strength of that support. HTTPS provides a secure connection across the internet between websites and their visitors, and is becoming the new baseline for public web services.</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that HTTPS generally <strong>does not affect</strong> whether a website is vulnerable to hacking.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTTPS and TLS data was last collected through a scan of the public internet on <strong>{{ scan_date | date("%B %d, %Y") }}</strong>.
